# Quotes and Code Blocks

## Quotes

To add quotes, use a greater than sign:

> This is a quote

This is a multi-line quote:

> Here is some multiline quotes.
> Another line.
> Quotes get put on the same line, if space allows.

## Code Blocks

To make a code block in your text, use three backticks:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

You can also have codes within your text like this: `echo hello world!`
